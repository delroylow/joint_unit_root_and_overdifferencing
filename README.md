# Project 1: Problem with Joint Unit Root Test and Inconsistent Estimators in Over-Differenced Model

This project uses **Monte Carlo Simulation** to demonstrate the downside of adopting both Augmented Dickey-Fuller (*ADF*) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (*KPSS*) test jointly in distinguishing unit root series from stationary processes. Also, another **Monte Carlo Simulation** has been conducted in order to show that least square estimators applied to over-differenced model is inconsistent and the mathematical proof is provided as well. 

  * Analysis is conducted on `R Programming`;
  * Document is prepared on `R Markdown` and `Latex`;
  * Required packages to replicate: `tseries`, `tidyverse` and `data.table`;
  * **FULL DISCUSSION**, check *.html* file; **R CODES**, check *.R* file.
